            Game-Making Deathmatch (GMD) is our annual videogame-making competition where participants work in partners or by
            themselves to create their own videogames based on a given theme. Participants of GMD will then have a couple months to
            finish their videogame creations, and once this time limit is up, the submitted entries will be evaluated by a special
            panel of judges in a variety of categories. The top games of their categories will win amazing prizes, but if you submit
            a game, any game, you will win something too!
