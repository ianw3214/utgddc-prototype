                The Game Design & Development Club (GDDC) is a recognized student campus group at the University of Toronto on
                the St. George Campus. The club was formed in the fall of 2003, under the name Game Programming Club (GPC), to
                attract students with an interest in video games and video game development.</br></br>
        
                Weâ€™re dedicated to helping people interested in anything related to game design and development such as:
                programming, sound, music, business, and art.</br></br>
        
                Events we host include: tutorials, discussions, guest speakers, game jams, and competitions(like the annual Game
                Making Deathmatch). During guest speaker events you can learn from and meet professional developers from a
                variety of backgrounds.
