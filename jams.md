A game jam is like a “hackathon”, but you are challenged to make a game in a weekend. You can team up or work alone, but by the end, you’ll have a completed game. Join us for a weekend of creation and fun! If you’re new to making games, check out our “tools” page.


The theme for this game jam will be announced soon!
